## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind css
- [Alpine js](https://alpinejs.dev/) - Alpine js

### What I learned
- It was really a great challenge. I figured out how to position backgroun images and the different values works for it. Didn't find good solution to position background image so I add custom css and it worked. 
- Multiple dropdown and toggle effects on nav items was fun to make and experiment.

### Continued development
- Would like to work with little more complicated css layout and javascript projects.

### Useful resources
- original documents
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN
